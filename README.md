## Useful commands

- `yarn` install dependencies
- `yarn build` compile typescript to js
- `yarn deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region

This project require an active hosted zone already registered by route 53 at the domain defined in the cdk.json context. If you want to deploy it directly, you should have one hosted zone registered, otherwise, you can comment it and use the default domain name generated by cloudfront. You must be in HTTPS to use passkeys.

Under the `frontend`` folder:

- `yarn` install dependencies
- `yarn dev` launch a dev server
- `yarn build` build frontend

## Deploy
